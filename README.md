# streamskilldata

% Work In Progress %

A simple node app for streaming [`SkillData`](https://docs.mistyrobotics.com/docs/reference/sensor-data/#skilldata) from Misty to your terminal.

To run:

1. Clone/download the repo
2. Change the `ip` variable in `app.js` to your Misty's IP address
3. Navigate to the repo in your terminal
4. Do `npm install`
5. Do `npm start`
6. Run a skill to see its data stream to your terminal
7. Write a better version of this app where Misty's ip address isn't hard-coded into the app and where you can unsubscribe from `SkillData` events :smile:
